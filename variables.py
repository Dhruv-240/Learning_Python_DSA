'''
A word that can be used to store a value and can be called again and again
a word that is bined to some value


Best practice for a variables
> snake_case- user_iq instead of useriq
> Start with lowercase or underscore- abc, _abc 
> letter numbers and underscroes no spaces
> Case sensitive- "iq" is not the same as "IQ"
> Don't overwrite keywords- you can't use preused keyword for exaply print =5 cannot work
> make variable easily understandable and descriptive- age, 
> constants usualy meant for other programmers to never change it,typed in capitals - PI=3.14

'''
 

iq = 150
my_var=1
_this_var =2
Var2= 5
PI =3.14
a,b,c=1,2,3

print(b)

'''
Expression vs statement
expesion is something that broduces a value, while staemtn is the whole line, for example
a=b*2
here b*2 is an expression and entire "a=b*2" is a statement
'''

'''
Augmented asignemnt opperator
insead fo a= a+2
you can use
a+=2

to use this a must be previously defined
